# AnimateAnyone-Reproduced
Consistent and Controllable Image-to-Video Synthesis for Character Animation
This repository contains our reproduction of the AnimateAnyone model, a framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally consistent character animations from a single reference image and pose sequences. Our implementation aims to closely replicate the original pipeline while introducing extensions for improved usability, flexibility, and performance. This project is intended for academic research and demonstration purposes.
# üåü Features

High-Fidelity Animation: Generates detailed, realistic character animations with consistent appearance across frames.
Pose-Guided Control: Uses pose sequences (e.g., OpenPose keypoints) to drive character movements.
Temporal Consistency: Ensures smooth transitions between frames using advanced temporal modeling.
Extended Features:
Support for multiple pose formats (OpenPose, DensePose, and custom JSON-based keypoints).
Integration with ComfyUI for a streamlined workflow.
Optional text prompt conditioning for stylized animations.
Batch processing for generating multiple videos simultaneously.


Pre-trained Weights: Includes unofficial pre-trained weights adapted from the original model.
Video Demonstrations: Showcases results for various character types (humans, cartoons, humanoid figures).

# üìã Requirements

Python >= 3.10
CUDA >= 11.7 (for GPU acceleration)
GPU with at least 16GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3080 or better)
Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

# üõ† Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AnimateAnyone-Reproduced.git
cd AnimateAnyone-Reproduced


Set Up Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you encounter issues with the diffusers library, run:
pip install --force-reinstall diffusers>=0.26.1


Download Pre-trained Weights:Run the following command to automatically download weights to the ./pretrained_weights directory:
python scripts/download_weights.py

Alternatively, manually download weights from our HuggingFace page and place them in ./pretrained_weights.


# Extended Features
1. WaterMark added
Our model can add the watermark at the bottom of the video to show this video is generated by our model.

2. Text Prompt Conditioning
Add a text prompt to stylize the animation (e.g., "a cartoon character dancing in a futuristic city"):
python -m scripts.pose2vid \
    --config ./configs/prompts/animation.yaml \
    --reference_image ./data/reference/cartoon.png \
    --pose_sequence ./data/poses/cartoon_poses/ \
    --text_prompt "a cartoon character dancing in a futuristic city" \
    --output_dir ./outputs/

3. Batch Processing
Generate multiple videos in a single run by providing a directory of reference images and corresponding pose sequences:
python -m scripts.batch_pose2vid \
    --config ./configs/prompts/batch_animation.yaml \
    --input_dir ./data/batch_input/ \
    --output_dir ./outputs/batch/
